# MeowScript 🐾

MeowScript is an **self-hosting programming language** with its own compiler and virtual machine.

- Written in **C++** (bootstrap) and **MeowScript itself** (self-hosted).
- Includes a **custom VM** with garbage collection and standard libraries (array, string, object, etc.).
- Supports **AOT compilation**, caching, and incremental builds.
- Designed and developed by a high-school student in Vietnam 🇻🇳.

> Not just a toy — MeowScript compiles itself and runs real programs.
